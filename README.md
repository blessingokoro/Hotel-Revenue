GOAL

Developed a database to analyze and visualize hotel booking data
Used a visual data story (dashboard using Power BI to present to the stakeholders) to know if the hotel revenue is growing by year and the trends in the data.

Here are some questions i was interested in answering:

1) Is the hotel revenue growing by?
2) Should we increase our parking lot size?
3) What trends can we see in the data?

I took the following steps to create my analysis

1) Pulling the data, cleaning it and preparing it for analysis.
2) Creating charts and placing them in a dashboard tab.
3) Utilizing pivot tables to aggregate KPIs at the top of the page.
4) Creating slicers and syncing all tables together for filtering.
5) Formatting all sections of the dashboard and creating an overall theme.
